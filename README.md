# Motion-Based-Message-Conveyor-For-Paralytic-or-Disabled-Person

- Among the large number of advancements done in the medical sector, very few actually focus on helping patients with disabilities to communicate.
- Monitoring Systems make it easier for doctors to collect and observe a patient’s vitals.
- In the current scenario , the patient has to be dependent on a family member or mostly a ward boy both of which have to attend to the patient constantly.
- Our objective is to make such patients independent to communicate with the nurse by the simple task of tilting a device located on his finger or any other part of the body that is capable of movement.
- This will not only help the patient but also easy out the nurse’s job.
- As a single nurse is responsible for a number of patients, the time required for each nurse to visit every patient to meet his needs will be saved.
- After the patient sends the message the nurse can remotely monitor their requests and provide assistance without any further delay. A buzzer located at the nurse’s desk will alert the nurse in case of an emergency.
